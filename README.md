# Random_Number_Generator_ForPracticeQuestions
Random Number Generator, this snip of code gives me an arbitrary number to choose a practice questions to perform "lol just a lil fun, i wanted to see what i could create..." 

"""This is a little script i made to randomly generate numbers. I am studding python with
problems and solutions at w3resource.com... rather than select a problem to solve, i created this script
that will give me random problems to solve"""
